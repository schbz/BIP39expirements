## About this repo:

I was just kind of curious about what commonly used english words were excluded from the BIP39 word pool, so I wrote this python script(filter.py) to find the difference between two lists and record them in a new text file. This

output txt files here contain results from filter.py. Perhaps this would be useful if you wanted to turn a seed phrase into a sentence without risking any confusion when it came time to import the seed to a new wallet.
